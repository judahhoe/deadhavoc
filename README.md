# Dead Havoc
## The last bastion of humanity

Dead havoc is a singleplayer zombie top-down shooter made with godot engine.
Feel free to download and play the game. I also won't mind usage of any code that I wrote.

Special thanks to:
- [Michał Serowiński](https://github.com/himynameismickey) for amazing music and most of the SFX
- [Tomasz Witkowski](https://github.com/tomwit11) for majority off graphical assets

## Present and future
For now the project is on hold but maybe in the future I will come back and work on it once again or build something else using parts of this game.

## Before playing
The game is displayed correctly only on the 1920x1080 resolution, other resolutions may and will have issues.

## Installation
To play the game simply download DeadHavoc.zip from releases, extract and run the .exe file

## Uninstallation
To fully remove all files from your device you need to (apart from files included in the .zip file) delete files in:
- Windows: %APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\DeadHavoc
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/DeadHavoc
- Linux: ~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/DeadHavoc

# Dead Havoc
## The last bastion of humanity

Dead havoc is a singleplayer zombie top-down shooter made with godot engine.
Feel free to download and play the game. I also won't mind usage of any code that I wrote.

Special thanks to:
[Michał Serowiński](https://github.com/orgs/hauntedzone/people/himynameismickey) for amazing music and most of the SFX
[Tomasz Witkowski](https://github.com/orgs/hauntedzone/people/tomwit11) for majority off graphical assets

## Present and future
For now the project is on hold but maybe in the future I will come back and work on it once again or build something else using parts of this game.
